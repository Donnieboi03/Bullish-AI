This is a file for backtesting my natrual language processing strategy.

I have two files "fin_sentiment" for processing news to sentiment, "main_strategy" for my main trading strategy.

main_strategy contains all the code you will need to run to have the model work. This is the base model, so that means it will not have the most up to date features.

I am continously updating/backtesting the strategy so if I feel the base model needs a update I will do so. Thank you.
